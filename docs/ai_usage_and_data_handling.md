> Replace this document with your organization’s official policy. Keep a link here for quick reference.

## Default safe rules (starter)
- Do not paste secrets (keys, tokens, passwords) into any tool.
- Do not paste sensitive customer data or operational data into non-approved tools.
- Prefer using approved enterprise AI offerings with logging/audit controls.
- Treat AI output as untrusted until validated by tests and code review.

## Suggested additions (org-specific)
- Approved tool list
- Data classification guidance (what can/can’t be shared)
- Incident reporting for accidental disclosure
- Retention policy for prompts/outputs
